Movie Trailer Project 9/24/2017
=======================

Description
-----------------------

A project completed for Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. 
In this project, I wrote server-side Python code to store a list of my favourite movies,
including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I then used the code to generate a 
static web page allowing visitors to browse the movies I input and watch their trailers.
This project was my chance to write my first application that is accesible via a web browser.


Requirements
-----------------------

To run the program, must have version 2.7 of Python as well as IDLE downloaded.
Also, all files in this project must be in the same folder.


Instructions to Run Program
-----------------------

In idle, open media.py and choose the run option in the toolbar. 
In addition to choosing the run option, you can press f5 on your keyboard.
